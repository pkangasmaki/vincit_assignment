### Vincit pre-assignment


Description:

_This program analyzes historical stock data and it provides information and statistic about stock market prices. Since we were working on a budget (Scrooge refused to pay us more than 0,2$ / hour and would not give us access to the top testers of the country), we could not provide testing for the project._

_npm install_

_npm start_      **<-** Run program
