### Vincit pre-assignment


Description:

_This program analyzes historical stock data and it provides information and statistic about stock market prices. Since we were working on a budget (Scrooge refused to pay us more than 0,2$ / hour and would not give us access to the top testers of the country), we could not provide testing for the project._

Instructions for the program:

**backend**

_npm install_

_npm start_     <- Run program

_npm run dev_   <- Run in development mode (nodemon)

_npm run lint_  <- Eslint


important urls:

_/api/stocks_

_/api/stocks/range?start=01/13/2021&end=01/19/2021   <- 01/13/2020 and 01/19/2021 are editable params_



**frontend**


_npm install_

_npm start_

_npm run lint_


Start by giving start date and end date in the input fields on the frontpage. There are two buttons; Volume and SMA5. Volume button displays statistics about the stocks volume and daily price changes. Whereas SMA5 button displays statistics about stocks opening price compared to the SMA5 price. You can switch between the two views by pushing either of the buttons.
